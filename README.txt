Pegel Plugin


Water is one of the most crucial matters not only for humans but also for living creatures on earth.
Besides the existence of water, managing water is a key factor for its consistency. Analyzing water
quality, transportation, measurement of water level, some examples we need to keep water
consistency. Therefore, there are many institutions that serve important taskforces. One of the
institutions is Pegel. Pegel, with its many stations across Germany, provides diverse measurements for
instance current water level, water temperature and miscellaneous. This plugin was developed for
QGIS to visualize Pegel stations with their water level measurements.
